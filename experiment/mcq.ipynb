      "The Heroes of Olympus is a pentalogy of fantasy-adventure novels written by American author Rick Riordan. The novels detail a conflict between Greek demigods, Roman demigods, and Gaea. In the fourth book of the series, there is also a fight against Tartarus, which, in Greek mythology, was the darkest and deepest point of the Underworld.\n",
      "\n",
      "The series can be read as a standalone volume, but is meant to be read after Percy Jackson & the Olympians. Riordan introduces Roman mythology in the series alongside several new characters, primarily from the Roman Camp Jupiter. The first book of the series, The Lost Hero, was published on October 12, 2010.[4] The final entry in the series, The Blood of Olympus, was published on October 7, 2014.[5] The story is continued in the sequel series The Trials of Apollo.\n",
      "The Heroes of Olympus is centered around a prophecy, introduced in The Last Olympian, that predicted seven demigods would unite to protect the world from an awakening new enemy, the Earth goddess Gaea. Demigods from both the Greek camp, Camp Half-Blood, and a newfound Roman camp, Camp Jupiter, unite to save the world from being destroyed by Gaea. The prophecy reads:\n",

Some other important characters are Nico di Angelo, son of Hades; Reyna Avila Ramirez-Arellano, Praetor of Camp Jupiter and daughter of Bellona; and Gleeson Hedge, a satyr.\n",
      "The novel begins by introducing Jason Grace, Piper McLean and Leo Valdez, three newly discovered demigods who travel to Camp Half-Blood in response to a prophecy. They set off on a quest to prevent the rebirth of the giant king Porphyrion and rescue Piper's father, who has been kidnapped by another giant, Enceladus. Jason, who has amnesia, also begins to remember pieces of his past throughout the book - most importantly, that he comes from a Roman camp for demigods. Camp Half-Blood resolves to seek out this other camp both to gain allies in the fight against Gaea, the giants' mother and commander, and to locate the missing demigod Percy Jackson.\n",
      "The novel opens with Percy Jackson, struck with amnesia, discovering Camp Jupiter and meeting several Roman demigods. After receiving a prophecy from Mars, Percy, Frank Zhang, and Hazel Levesque travel to Alaska to stop the rise of the giant Alcyoneus and free the god Thanatos, whom the giant has captured. After successfully completing their mission, the group returns to Camp Jupiter to defend it from yet another giant, Polybotes, and his army. After repelling this invasion, the demigods from Camp Jupiter go to meet the delegation from Camp Half-Blood arriving in the flying ship known as the Argo II.[6] This book is set in June.\n",
      "After the Argo II unintentionally fires on Camp Jupiter, the seven demigods of the \"Prophecy of Seven\" — Percy Jackson, Annabeth Chase, Leo Valdez, Piper McLean, Jason Grace, Frank Zhang, and Hazel Levesque — rush to escape the angered Roman campers. The Argo II is damaged, and the group splits up to find supplies to help Leo fix it. Hazel and Leo go out to try to find Celestial bronze and lime for calcium carbonate when they encounter Nemesis, the universal (meaning Roman and Greek) goddess of revenge. Nemesis's form is different for both Leo and Hazel, Leo seeing his Aunt Rosa and Hazel seeing one of her old teachers. Nemesis tells Leo that the gods are split between their Greek and Roman forms, making them disoriented and confused. This means a civil war is on the rise between the Romans and the Greeks. Nemesis tells Leo that he will be the \"seventh wheel\", and not fit in with the Seven. She also tells Leo that he will stumble upon a problem that he cannot solve. Nemesis offers Leo help — for a price. She leaves Leo and Hazel frazzled, confused, and angry. The Seven travel to Rome, guided by the \"Mark of Athena\", a magical talisman designed to lead children of Athena to the missing Athena Parthenos. During their journey, they hear that Nico di Angelo has been captured by the Aloadae, and go to rescue him. Although they successfully free him and locate the statue, Annabeth and Percy are pulled into Tartarus by Gaea, and Nico promises Percy to get the other demigods to the \"Doors of Death\".[7] This book is set between June and July.\n",
      "In Tartarus, Percy and Annabeth travel towards the \"Doors of Death\", the only pathway back to the mortal world, with help from Bob the Titan, hoping to escape and simultaneously stop more monsters from getting through. In the mortal world, the remaining demigods search for the mortal side of the Doors to help open them. They also meet with Reyna Avila Ramírez-Arellano, a Roman demigod; she, Nico, and Coach Hedge leave with the Athena Parthenos from Epirus, Greece, and Shadow Travel to Camp Half-Blood.

      "Nico di Angelo: The 14-year-old son of Hades. Born in the 1930s in Italy, his father Hades sent him and his sister to the Lotus Hotel and Casino, that sucked them out of time for decades, so he only feels and looks 14.

In the fourth book of the series, there is also a fight against Tartarus, which, in Greek mythology, was the darkest and deepest point of the Underworld.\n",

      "The series can be read as a standalone volume, but is meant to be read after Percy Jackson & the Olympians. Riordan introduces Roman mythology in the series alongside several new characters, primarily from the Roman Camp Jupiter. The first book of the series, The Lost Hero, was published on October 12, 2010.[4] The final entry in the series, The Blood of Olympus, was published on October 7, 2014.[5] The story is continued in the sequel series The Trials of Apollo.\n",
      "The Heroes of Olympus is centered around a prophecy, introduced in The Last Olympian, that predicted seven demigods would unite to protect the world from an awakening new enemy, the Earth goddess Gaea. Demigods from both the Greek camp, Camp Half-Blood, and a newfound Roman camp, Camp Jupiter, unite to save the world from being destroyed by Gaea. The prophecy reads:\n",

They set off on a quest to prevent the rebirth of the giant king Porphyrion and rescue Piper's father, who has been kidnapped by another giant, Enceladus. Jason, who has amnesia, also begins to remember pieces of his past throughout the book - most importantly, that he comes from a Roman camp for demigods. Camp Half-Blood resolves to seek out this other camp both to gain allies in the fight against Gaea, the giants' mother and commander, and to locate the missing demigod Percy Jackson.\n",
      "The novel opens with Percy Jackson, struck with amnesia, discovering Camp Jupiter and meeting several Roman demigods. After receiving a prophecy from Mars, Percy, Frank Zhang, and Hazel Levesque travel to Alaska to stop the rise of the giant Alcyoneus and free the god Thanatos, whom the giant has captured. After successfully completing their mission, the group returns to Camp Jupiter to defend it from yet another giant, Polybotes, and his army. After repelling this invasion, the demigods from Camp Jupiter go to meet the delegation from Camp Half-Blood arriving in the flying ship known as the Argo II.[6] This book is set in June.\n",
      "After the Argo II unintentionally fires on Camp Jupiter, the seven demigods of the \"Prophecy of Seven\" — Percy Jackson, Annabeth Chase, Leo Valdez, Piper McLean, Jason Grace, Frank Zhang, and Hazel Levesque — rush to escape the angered Roman campers. The Argo II is damaged, and the group splits up to find supplies to help Leo fix it. Hazel and Leo go out to try to find Celestial bronze and lime for calcium carbonate when they encounter Nemesis, the universal (meaning Roman and Greek) goddess of revenge. Nemesis's form is different for both Leo and Hazel, Leo seeing his Aunt Rosa and Hazel seeing one of her old teachers. Nemesis tells Leo that the gods are split between their Greek and Roman forms, making them disoriented and confused. This means a civil war is on the rise between the Romans and the Greeks. Nemesis tells Leo that he will be the \"seventh wheel\", and not fit in with the Seven. She also tells Leo that he will stumble upon a problem that he cannot solve. Nemesis offers Leo help — for a price. She leaves Leo and Hazel frazzled, confused, and angry. The Seven travel to Rome, guided by the \"Mark of Athena\", a magical talisman designed to lead children of Athena to the missing Athena Parthenos. During their journey, they hear that Nico di Angelo has been captured by the Aloadae, and go to rescue him. Although they successfully free him and locate the statue, Annabeth and Percy are pulled into Tartarus by Gaea, and Nico promises Percy to get the other demigods to the \"Doors of Death\".[7] This book is set between June and July.\n",
      "In Tartarus, Percy and Annabeth travel towards the \"Doors of Death\", the only pathway back to the mortal world, with help from Bob the Titan, hoping to escape and simultaneously stop more monsters from getting through. In the mortal world, the remaining demigods search for the mortal side of the Doors to help open them. They also meet with Reyna Avila Ramírez-Arellano, a Roman demigod; she, Nico, and Coach Hedge leave with the Athena Parthenos from Epirus, Greece, and Shadow Travel to Camp Half-Blood.
